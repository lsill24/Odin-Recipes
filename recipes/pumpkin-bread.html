    <h1>Pumpkin Bread Recipe</h1>

    <img src="pumpkin bread.jpeg" alt="" style="height: 400px; width: 400px;">
    <p>An enticing aroma wafts through my house when this tender cake-like pumpkin
        bread is in the oven. I bake extra loaves to give as holiday gifts.
        My friends wait eagerly for it every year.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>5 large eggs</li>
        <li>1-1/4 cups canola oil</li>
        <li>1 can (15 ounces) solid-pack pumpkin</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>2 packages (3 ounces each) cook-and-serve vanilla pudding mix</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat the eggs. Add oil and pumpkin; beat until smooth. Combine remaining ingredients; gradually beat into pumpkin mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour batter into five greased 5-3/4x3x2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 325Â° for 50-55 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Editor's Note: Bread may also be baked in two greased 8x4x2-in. loaf pans for 75-80 minutes.</p>
