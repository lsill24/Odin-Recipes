        <p>Holiday breakfasts would not be the same at our house without this delicious coffee cake. 
            Whenever I take it anywhere, everyone raves about it and wants the recipe.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>3/4 cup butter, softened</li>
                <li>1-1/2 cups sugar</li>
                <li>4 large eggs, room temperature</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 cup sour cream</li>

                <h3>Filling</h3>
                <li>1/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries</li>

                <h3>Glaze</h3>
                <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
                <li>2 to 3 tablespoons 2% milk</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Directions</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350°. In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy, 5-7 minutes. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with sour cream, beating well after each addition.</li>
                <li>Spoon a third of the batter into a greased and floured 10-in. fluted tube pan. Combine brown sugar, flour and cinnamon; sprinkle half over batter. Top with half of the berries. Repeat layers. Top with remaining batter.</li>
                <li>Bake 55-65 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely. Combine glaze ingredients; drizzle over coffee cake.</li>
                
            </ol>

            <p>Editor's Note: If using frozen blueberries, use without thawing to avoid discoloring the batter.</p>
